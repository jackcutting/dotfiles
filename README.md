# Dotfiles

A small collection of config files that can be shared across all devices (running macOS or Linux)

## Requirements

- Zsh
- Vim
- Tmux
- Stow

## Installation

Once all the required software is installed, this repo can be cloned and `stow` can be run from the repo dir:

```sh
$ stow .
```

## Uninstallation

It is possible to uninstall the dotfiles by running:

```sh
$ stow -D .
```

## Potential Updates (TODO)

- Add Makefile for installing/uninstalling
- Add config for Vim (.vimrc)
